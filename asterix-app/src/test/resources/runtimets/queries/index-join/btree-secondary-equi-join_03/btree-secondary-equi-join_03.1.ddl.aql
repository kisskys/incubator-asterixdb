/*
 * Description    : Equi joins two datasets, DBLP and CSX, based on their authors.
 *                  Both datasets have a secondary btree index on authors. So, given the 'indexnl' hint
 *                  we expect the join to be transformed into an indexed nested-loop join.
 *                  (outer relation: the first relation described in the for-loop, inner relation: the other relation)
 * Success        : Yes
