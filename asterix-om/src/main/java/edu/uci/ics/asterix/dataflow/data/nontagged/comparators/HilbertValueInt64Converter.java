/*
 * This compares two points based on the hilbert curve. Currently, it only supports
 * doubles (this can be changed by changing all doubles to ints as there are no
 * number generics in Java) in the two-dimensional space. For more dimensions, the
 * state machine has to be automatically generated. The idea of the fractal generation
 * of the curve is described e.g. in http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=383528&type=pdf
 * 
 * Unlike the described approach, this comparator does not compute the hilbert value at 
 * any point. Instead, it only evaluates how the two inputs compare to each other. This
 * is done by starting at the lowest hilbert resolution and zooming in on the fractal until
 * the two points are in different quadrants.
 * 
 * As a performance optimization, the state of the state machine is saved in a stack and 
 * maintained over comparisons. The idea behind this is that comparisons are usually in a
 * similar area (e.g. geo coordinates). Zooming in from [-MAX_VALUE, MAX_VALUE] would take
 * ~300 steps every time. Instead, the comparator start from the previous state and zooms out
 * if necessary
